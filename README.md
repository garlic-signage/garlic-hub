## Development Roadmap

Garlic-Hub is being developed in a phased approach to ensure stability and optimal performance across different usage scenarios. The platform will be rolled out in three primary editions, each tailored to distinct needs:

1. **Edge Edition (Phase 1)**  
   The first phase focuses on the Edge Edition, designed for single-device deployments or small setups. This edition will feature core CMS functions, including media management and SMIL-based playlist creation, with a lightweight architecture optimized for devices like Raspberry Pi or Android-based media players. The Edge Edition sets the foundation upon which the more comprehensive editions will be built.

2. **Core Edition (Phase 2)**  
   The Core Edition is aimed at mid-sized networks, managing up to 20 media players. This phase will introduce extended management features, improved reporting capabilities, and a more robust device management layer, tailored for businesses with small networks and limited hardware.

3. **Enterprise Edition (Phase 3)**  
   In the final phase, Garlic-Hub will evolve into an enterprise-grade platform, supporting large-scale digital signage networks. The Enterprise Edition will offer advanced features such as full SaaS/on-premise hosting, multi-user access with role-based permissions, and enhanced analytics for real-time insights. This edition will cater to companies needing scalable, comprehensive digital signage solutions for diverse locations.

Each phase will build on the features of the previous editions, ensuring a smooth upgrade path as Garlic-Hub grows into a complete digital signage management solution.
